# The_JAL_Project

## Brief description of The JAL Project
### The JAL Project means the Judicious And Logical use of water.

Water is the most important and critical part of our life. This clear, amorphous liquid is key to our life. 
Water Conservation and Monitoring System would enable a society or cluster of houses in the vicinity to monitor, limit and record their water usage via application in their phone. Users may choose laissez faire or intermittent flow of water to their homes. The project is expected in an acropolis form. 

The main tank would be connected to a sub tank of the house, which is connected by a flow meters. The constant usage of water will be recorded over the cloud for which we prefer "AWS", and thus this data can be used for multiple purposes using various technologies like data science so we can know how much amount of water is used at a particular time. The representation and depiction of model would be maverick.
 
This project aims and has the potential to be the final block in this long journey of "conserve and preserve water" jigsaw puzzle.
